                Career Plans
            </h1><br>
            <p>Within the group, none of the career choices changed from assignment 2 to assignment 3 .    We found that two of our members had the same ideal job, being Speedie and Declan. Both of these members were aiming for a Technical Analyst position at the Australian Federal Police which would involve working together with the Senior Technical Specialists and Investigators at the AFP to help support Cyber Crime Operations teams with the technical skills and experience necessary to investigate breaches of the law using cybertechnology.

                
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Brad’s ideal job was that of a Senior Systems Engineer at one of Australia’s defence organisations, which seems to align similarly with Speedie and Declan’s career ideals as they would be deeply involved in the safety and protection of Australia and its citizens. His choice of job would involve working with their pre-existing team in a Wintel/Linux environment and using Hypervisor hardware/software to ████████████████REDACTED████████████████ .Another of our group members Ash was looking to go into a role as a Helpdesk Engineer which in a similar fashion will involve helping people, just in a different way. The role would involve providing technical support for business customers and consumers or helping maintain workplace technology, all usually via remote methods.Last but not least, Miller’s ideal job choice was that of a UX/UI Designer, which would involve designing websites and applications to be more user friendly and easily engaged by the customer creating a better experience for them.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The most common factor throughout all of these positions is that they will all involve helping people either directly or indirectly, which further demonstrates how this group consists of caring and kind people, who are always willing to assist when needed.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                While most of the core skills required will be the same for all the career choices the biggest difference between them would be the soft skills required , such as Speedie and Declan would be required to write large detailed reports where as Ash’s career choice would seldom require such or the difference in the reliance of teamwork , where Ash and Millers careers would require some  team work ,  the majority of the time they would be working on their own creating solutions for problems , where as Declan,Speedie and Brads career choices would require and focus on constant teamwork.
        
            <p>
                Every member of the team agrees that their best career path to achieve these ideal positions will involve completing their Bachelors Degree in IT, gaining relevant experience for the position that they want, and gaining the appropriate IT certifications to make them not only a suitable candidate for the position but also a highly competitive one.
