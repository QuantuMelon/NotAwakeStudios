            <p>Within the group, we found that two of our members had the same ideal job, being Speedie and Declan. Both of these members were aiming for a Technical Analyst position at the Australian Federal Police which would involve working together with the Senior Technical Specialists and Investigators at the AFP to help support Cyber Crime Operations teams with the technical skills and experience necessary to investigate breaches of the law using cybertechnology.</p><br>
<p>Brad’s ideal job was that of a Senior Systems Engineer at one of Australia’s defence organisations, which seems to align similarly with Speedie and Declan’s career ideals as they would be deeply involved in the safety and protection of Australia and its citizens. His choice of job would involve working with their pre-existing team in a Wintel/Linux environment and using Hypervisor hardware/software to ████████████████████████████████████████REDACTED██████████████████████████████████████████.</p><br>
<p>Another of our group members Ash was looking to go into a role as a Helpdesk Engineer which in a similar fashion will involve helping people, just in a different way. The role would involve providing technical support for business customers and consumers or helping maintain workplace technology, all usually via remote methods.</p><br>
	<p>Misty's ideal job was as an IT Moral Support Officer or ITMSO for short. Whilst this job dosen't require as many IT-based skills as the other members' ideal jobs, it still requires a skill-set aimed towards compassion, empathy and general wellbeing both mentally and physically. This is in keeping with the groups' roles of helping and caring about our wider communities.</p><br>  
<p>Last but not least, Miller’s ideal job choice was that of a UX/UI Designer, which would involve designing websites and applications to be more user friendly and easily engaged by the customer creating a better experience for them.</p><br>

<p>The most common factor throughout all of these positions is that they will all involve helping people either directly or indirectly, which further demonstrates how this group consists of caring and kind people, who are always willing to assist when needed.</p><br>
<p>Apart from at the technical level where different tools, skills, and knowledge are required for each position, the main differing parts of these jobs are how they help make the world a better place. For instance, the AFP role can be directly attributed to making Australia a safer place for its residents, but the UX/UI role can be just as important as it helps save people time, make sites more readable and accessible for people of all types, such as the elderly or those that are less technologically knowledgeable.</p><br>
<p>Every member of the team agrees that their best career path to achieve these ideal positions will involve completing their Bachelors Degree in IT, gaining relevant experience for the position that they want, and gaining the appropriate IT certifications to make them not only a suitable candidate for the position but also a highly competitive one.</p>
