          <p>The information gathered here will be invaluable to the group as it gives us all a greater insight into what makes us tick, how our minds react to certain things, and the best way for each of us to learn new things. </p><br>

<p>Having all taken the MBTI tests, we were able to discern a few things from the results, such as that the group has an even mix of Introverted and Extroverted personality types which is useful because having both types present in the group can help push everyone to become more of an ambivert which in turn means that we can have the perfect balance of team members who can assert themselves and their ideas without being pushy. We also learnt that there is an even balance of Sensing and Intuitive types, as well as the Judging and Perceiving types, however, we found that most of the group leans towards the Feeling trait rather than the Thinking trait which means that decisions made can be biased towards emotions rather than logical decisions.</p><br>

<p>By knowing the group’s specific learning styles, we are presented with the opportunity to tailor our methods of communication to be as effective as possible for everyone. For example, if Brad needed to teach Declan and Miller how to use a program, he would choose to use some sort of visual method to help them learn (e.g. Showing them via screen sharing), however, if he was teaching Speedie and Declan, then he would choose to use a different method, one that is primarily auditory (e.g. A group voice call) to help them understand and process the information more effectively.</p><br>

<p>Finally, the results of the Big Five Personality Test help show everyone’s different intensities of the traits tested for, being Extroversion which is a factor of how outgoing and social you are, Emotional Stability which is a measure of your ability to remain stable and balanced, Agreeableness which is a factor of how friendly and optimistic you may be, Conscientiousness which is how careful and diligent you are, and Intellect/Imagination which is how open to new experiences you are. Having this knowledge of each other is very beneficial to the group as we are then able to use it to further understand how we all think and why we may disagree with certain ideas, along with who may be better suited to do certain jobs within the team.</p>
