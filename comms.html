        <p>
        Our group worked well together on Assignment 2, though we did all notice we all needed to improve our team communication. In an effort to improve our communication as a whole for Assignment 3 we put in place an agreement to use Discord at least once a day to update our individual progress and pick up any new tasks that needed doing. We had the main meeting on Friday nights to cover anything that the group as a whole needed to complete. <br> <br>
After having received feedback from Assignment 2 we noticed that one large area we needed to improve on as a group process was ensuring the work being completed was also being proofread as it was uploaded. To combat this problem we put in place a process of proofreading each part of the assignment that was uploaded to Google Docs as a separate document before the work was added to the main document. With these two new processes in place, we are confident that it will improve the overall quality of work produced in Assignment 3 compared to Assignment 2.
