        <h1>Group Processes and Communication</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Discord remained the primary source of effective communication for assignment 3 - Not Awake Studios. This form of communication also assisted with assignment progression, with each team member expected to utilise Discord at least once daily to reacquaint with the assignment and its proceedings. Main meetings had been established for on Friday evenings due to each member being available at this time. 
            </p>

        <p>
            As well as Discord, the team continued utilisation of Trello for task progression tracking; Github and Google Drive are also used to upload our work once it is completed and proofread. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="t4">
        <p>
            Individual work is uploaded to Google Docs for proofreading and group collaboration  before being uploaded to Github. The reason for utilising this process is due to the lack of  editing in the team's second assignment. In the third Assignment, each member conducted prominent checks prior to upload on GitHub.         </p>

    <div class="t4">
        
        <p>
            An agreement was made between the team that if any member is non-respondent; only the limited work contributed by that  team member will be counted towards their share of the assignment. Furthermore, the other team members would be given the remainder of the work to be distributed evenly between the remainder of the team and the work percentage to show their extra efforts.
